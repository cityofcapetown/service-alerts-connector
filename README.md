# ‚ö†Ô∏è City of Cape Town Service Alerts ‚ö†Ô∏è
This repository contains the specifications and code that support the public service alert data API. 

This API is the product of an initiative by various departments within the City of Cape Town to make available critical
information about the delivery of services that is both timely **and** useful.

### üèóÔ∏è Generating Client Libraries from the API Specification

Included in this repo is [an OpenAPI specification for the data available](./service-alerts-api.yaml). This specification
can be used to generate a client library in the language of your choice, using tools such as the [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

#### Python Example

Here is how you would do it for python, using the `openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` Docker image:

1. Clone this repo, and change to it.
2. Generate the API using the docker image (The client library will be generated in the `/dist` directory within this repo.):
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/local" openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
        -i /local/service-alerts-api.yaml \
        -g python \
        --package-name cct_service_alerts \
        -o /local/dist/python
    ```
3. Install the dependencies for the new client library: `pip3 install -r ./dist/python/requirements.txt`
4. Give the new client library a spin using [this simple example script](./bin/api_example_script.py): `PYTHONPATH=./dist/python python3 bin/api_example_script.py`:
```
$ PYTHONPATH=./dist/python python3 bin/api_example_script.py

### ‚úâÔ∏è PubSub
We also maintain an [AWS SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) topic: `arn:aws:sns:af-south-1:566800947500:service-alerts`

The topic publishes whenever there are new alert(s) created. The content of the message will be a JSON array containing 
the contents of the alerts.

## ‚ùì FAQ ‚ùì
### What is a Service Alert?
A service alert is a notification of a significant disruption to the delivery of a service provided by the City of Cape
Town. While any loss of service is regrettable, it is hoped that by providing as much information as possible about the
outage, its effect may be mitigated.

This dataset was originally created for internal use by customer relations staff, to assist in answering queries from
residents.

### Who is capturing this information?
The short answer is officials at the City of Cape Town. 

The more detailed answer is that it is usually administrative officials in the technical operations centres that 
coordinate the operations of various essential services such as Water and Sanitation, Energy, etc.

### Why are you making this information publicly available?
There are several reasons:
* Mitigating the effect of service disruptions to residents by sharing information to help them plan.
* Reducing load on the City's Customer Relations functions
* Transparency - as public officials, we are strongly encouraged to operate as openly as possible.

### What do you want people to do with this information?
Make this information available wherever it may be useful, in the best possible form.

### Who is using this information?
* [Unofficial Mastodon Bot](https://botsin.space/@coct_service_alerts) and [its code](https://github.com/cityofcapetown/mastodon-bots)
* [CCT Data Science Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/DataOpm) and [its code](https://github.com/cityofcapetown/twitter-bots)
